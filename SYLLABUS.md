  * NOTE: regarding email communication - I don't expect you to respond to my emails late at night or on weekends. I will do my best to get back to you as soon as I can, but please give me at least 24hrs before sending me a reminder. Before emailing, you should answer the following questions:
    * 1. Did you do a web search first (e.g. did you google for an answer to your question?)
    * 2. Did you check the class notes or relevant course material for the answer?
    * 3. Did you ask a classmate or collegue who might know the answer?
    * 4. If I was Tom Igoe or Allison Parish, would you still ask me that question?

## MATERIALS

See <a href="MATERIALS.md" target="_blank">MATERIALS</a> for details on course materials such as readings, watchables, inspiration, quantified self apps and additional resources.


## DESCRIPTION

There are more “free” applications and services than ever before that help us to quantify and track what we do, when, how, and with whom. The quantified self holds the promise of improving our lives, but there is an ambivalence to how these technologies are affecting our lives. This course will examine, question, and critique the perspectives of personal data and “the quantified self” from multiple perspectives. We will explore these perspectives by working with the tools and methodologies for collecting personal data and generate visuals and other tangible output from these data. We will introduce students to guest speakers, review and critique readings, projects, and software around the quantified self, and experiment through lab-based exercises that encourage a fluency with digital and analog visualization and data tracking tools.

In this 12 week course, students will explore the topic of “the quantified self”. Together we will learn how to create narratives from our own personal data by collecting, retrieving, and analyzing patterns in our data, sketching and designing visualizations (e.g. charts, maps, etc), and developing programmatic methods to generate output from these data.

Students will: 
1. Learn to navigate Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and databases that allow for creation and retrieval of personal data
2. Practice various programmatic methods for analyzing and visualizing individual data
3. Build visualizations and other creative output using their own data 

By working with and visualizing their own quantified self, students will: 
1.  Be exposed to the debates around personal data
2. Gain an understanding of the implications of personal data vis-à-vis privacy
3. Learn to better understand the ways personal data can help or harm individuals
4. Have an awareness for the landscape of quantified self initiatives across domains (e.g. from medicine to sex to eating)


## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

- Exposure to techniques for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing personal data
- Become conversational in the discussion around the quantified self movement (who’s who, what’s what, the history, ambivalence). 
- Create visualizations (or other tangible output) that represents the student’s own relationship personal data 
- “Find yourself” in the data your produce -- how does it represent you? How does it not?

## GRADING

Students will be evaluated on effort, personal progress and growth, class participation, assignments, and the final project. It is understood that coding and making things is tough, therefore your effort, curiosity, and engagement is of utmost importance. You will be graded on your progress throughout the class, your ability to complete assignments on time, your interaction with peers, and your ability to justify your decisions thoughtfully.

**GRADE CALCULATION**:

Here is a basic breakdown of graded tasks along that trajectory:
* 10% Attendance/Participation
* 30% Assignments
* 20% Project Proposal
* 40% Final Project, completed on conclusion of the course
* TOTAL: 100%

Here's an outline of how your work will generally be evaluated. The explaners of each category are rough guidelines for how I assign numbers (or quantify 😉) to the work you are producing in this class. Inspired by [cmda-tt course](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-17-18/tree/master/assessment-3).

| Category | 1 - 2 pts | 3 - 4 pts | 5 - 6 pts | 7 - 8 pts | 9 - 10 pts |
| :------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| **Quality**  | The work is handed in late, broken, incomplete, undocumented, or shows lack of care or thought | The work is only partially documented and seems only partially complete | The work is documented and represents the student's concept and shows good effort | The work is well documented, thoughtful, and professional | The work shows mastery and is well polished |
| **Understanding** | There is either no substance or the student cannot explain or justify decision making | The work shows partial grasp of the concepts, but shows major gaps that could be addressed with more thought | The work is sensible and grounded and can be explained in a coherent manner | The work represents the concept well, references past and current work. The student can speak to more than 1 perspective. | The work shows strong graps of concepts and the state-of-the-art. The work is well received in both concept and implementation |
| **Application** | The work reflects very little conceptual references to the course materials; a general lack of awareness to methodology and implementation | The work applies methodology(ies) that have some potential, but not quite relevant or effective | The work uses methods that are appropriate and thoughtful. The application of methods are standard and show good potential | The work uses methods that are appropriate, thoughtful, and well implemented. There are innovative ideas that are shown in the application. | There work shows careful methodological considerations and is beautifully crafted, designed, and presented. |

**LATE ASSIGNMENTS**:

The easiest thing to do is to just turn thing in on time. You get closure, I can give you careful and constructive feedback, and everyone is happy. In the case you can't get you assignment in on time here is the deal:

- 1. email me informing me why your assignment is not submitted on time → 
- 2. submit documentation of what you've worked on so far, what went wrong, and what you plan to do →
- 3. late assignments will be marked down half a letter grade (or commensurate points given the scale above) until the assignment receives a C (or equivalent). Do not expect the same quality or timeliness of feedback for late assignments.

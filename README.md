### Description

There are more “free” applications and services than ever before that help us to quantify and track what we do, when, how, and with whom. The quantified self holds the promise of improving our lives, but there is an ambivalence to how these technologies are affecting our lives. This course will examine, question, and critique the perspectives of personal data and “the quantified self” from multiple perspectives. We will explore these perspectives by working with the tools and methodologies for collecting personal data and generate visuals and other tangible output from these data. 

We will introduce students to guest speakers, review and critique readings, projects, and software around the quantified self, and experiment through projects that encourage a fluency with digital and analog visualization and data tracking tools.

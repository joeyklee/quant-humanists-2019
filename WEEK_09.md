# WEEK `09`: APR 08 2019
## Special Topics: Tracking at Scale

> This week in Quant Humanists, we will be take a brief look into the domain of forced tracking and tracking at scale. We will examine situations when tracking is not a choice, but rather imposed on individuals through various institutions/organizations (e.g. via employers) and the implications of such granular tracking.

## Final Project Development

Begin/continue working on your final projects

### Methods for Moving forward
- Read - you'll never regret a little bit extra reading and refining your literature reviews. Looking into how people have framed their projects or research can help you articulate your own questions. 
- Define a style visual style guide (see below)
- Create a proof of concept using dummy or simulated data -- create a methodology for simulating data and then use that to create a proof of concept for your project (e.g. whether it is a visualization or otherwise)
  - e.g.: https://scotch.io/tutorials/generate-fake-data-for-your-javascript-applications-using-faker
  - e.g.: https://p5js.org/examples/math-noise-wave.html

### Optional but recommended: Style Guide  
- *About*: Create a style guide for your final project. 
- It doesn't have to be as detailed as this [one](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2014/03/12/datavizguide/) but it should have a few main sections, and you might take a look at the [duo linguo style guide](https://www.duolingo.com/design/) for inspiration:
- Resources on how to create a style guide can be found [here](FINAL-PROJECT-REFERENCES.md)

- Minimum Solution:
    * Colors (hex values chosen)
    * Fonts
    * Templates (e.g. buttons, icons, changes in state)

- Full Solution:
    * Logos
    * Colors
    * Typography
    * Iconography
    * Illustration
    * Buttons/Links
    * Input
    * Navigation
    * Progress
    * Exercises
